# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation - Cyber Security Internship Task 6

Welcome to the Password Strength Evaluation project! This task focuses on understanding password security, evaluating password strength, and learning about common password attacks.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Learn to create strong passwords and test their strength using online tools.
- **Tools Used:** Password Strength Checker ([passwordmeter.com](http://www.passwordmeter.com/))
- **Key Topics:** Password complexity, brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, phishing, rainbow table attacks.

## 🚨 Password Attack Types

### Brute Force Attack
- Attempts every combination.
- **Defense:** Complex, long passwords + MFA.

### Dictionary Attack
- Uses common word lists.
- **Defense:** Avoid predictable patterns.

### Credential Stuffing
- Reuses leaked credentials.
- **Defense:** Use unique passwords for each account.

### Phishing
- Tricks users to reveal passwords.
- **Defense:** Verify URLs, avoid suspicious links.

### Rainbow Table Attack
- Matches hashed passwords using precomputed tables.
- **Defense:** Use salting + strong hashing algorithms.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Longer and complex passwords are significantly stronger.
- Multi-factor authentication is essential.
- Password managers improve security and convenience.
- Avoid using the same password on multiple platforms.
